# Epic and Story Structure

**Epic Structure Decision:** Single epic containing 8-10 stories sequenced to minimize risk to the existing system. Stories will be ordered to ensure existing functionality remains intact throughout development, with each story including specific integration verification criteria.

## Epic 1: Insurance Data Entry Form Architecture Modernization

IV1.5: Form navigation between tabs works unchanged
IV1.6: Visual appearance remains identical to original

### Story 1.4: Extract Validation Module

As a user entering data, I want reliable validation feedback so that I receive clear error messages for invalid entries.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.4.1: Create validation.js module with field validation functions
1.4.2: Implement Aadhaar and PAN number validation
1.4.3: Add age calculation and nominee share validation
1.4.4: Provide user-friendly error messages without exposing technical details

**Integration Verification:**
IV1.4: All existing validation rules work identically
IV1.5: Error messages display in same locations and formats
IV1.6: Form submission blocked for invalid data as before
IV1.7: No false positives or negatives in validation logic

### Story 1.5: Extract AI Integration Module

As a user, I want reliable AI policy summaries so that the Gemini API integration continues to work with improved error handling.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.5.1: Create ai.js module with callGeminiAPI() and generateSummary() functions
1.5.2: Implement secure API key management
1.5.3: Add retry logic and user-friendly error messages for API failures
1.5.4: Maintain optional AI feature without breaking non-AI workflows

**Integration Verification:**
IV1.5: AI summary generation works with valid API key
IV1.6: Application functions normally when AI features are disabled
IV1.7: API errors display helpful messages instead of technical details
IV1.8: No impact on form performance when AI features unused

### Story 1.6: Implement Testing Framework

As a quality assurance specialist, I want automated tests so that I can validate functionality and prevent regressions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.6.1: Integrate Jest testing framework for browser environment
1.6.2: Create unit tests for utility functions (age calculation, currency formatting)
1.6.3: Implement integration tests for form validation and data persistence
1.6.4: Achieve 80% coverage for critical business logic

**Integration Verification:**
IV1.6: All existing functionality passes integration tests
IV1.7: Test execution does not impact production deployment
IV1.8: Test failures clearly indicate what functionality is broken
